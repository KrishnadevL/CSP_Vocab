<br />**Binary** is the base-2 number system used primarily by computers.  Instead of using base 10 (using digits 0-9), computers use only 0s and 1s to reflect the on/off of electrical logic gates. 
This is regarded as the simplest form of data. 
<br />**Hexadecimal** is the base-16 number systemis often used to compact binary data in order to make it more easily understandable. Hexadecimal is often used to represent RGB colors.
Example Code: 
```
blank spot
```
