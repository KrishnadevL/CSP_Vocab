## Binary/Hexadecimal 


### Definition
<br />**Binary** is the base-2 number system used primarily by computers.  Instead of using base 10 (using digits 0-9), computers use only 0s and 1s to reflect the on/off of electrical logic gates. This is regarded as the simplest form of data. 

<br />**Hexadecimal** is the base-16 number systemis often used to compact binary data in order to make it more easily understandable. Hexadecimal is often used to represent RGB colors.
