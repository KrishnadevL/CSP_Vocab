# Code Sequence, Procedures/Functions, Procedural Abstraction
## Code Sequence
<br>
Computers always follow sequence, meaning that they will always do things in an assigned order.  Code itself must be organized into a logical pattern, or else it will not be computer-readable.
<br>
# Procedures/Functions
<br>
Procedures, also called functions, are a block of code that take in input and return an output.  They can be refrenced in diffrent parts of code and be stored in libraries, collections of functions.
<br>
# Procedural Abstraction
Procedural abstraction is a type of documentation that lines out what each part of the code does.  It is useful for developing/testing code since each part has a defined and testable purpose.
