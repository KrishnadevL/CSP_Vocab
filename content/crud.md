# Read
Reads and prints out the contents of entries/columns/tables.  Called by the "SHOW" command in MySQL.

# Update
Updates the database as entries/columns/tables as they are created/deleted.

# Destroy
Mentioned above, it deletes entries/columns/tables from a database.  Called by the "DROP" command in a MySQL.
