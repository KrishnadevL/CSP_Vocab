# Lossy vs. Lossless
## Lossy 


### Definition
<br />**Lossless Compression** is an algorithm which can reduce the storage space required for a piece of information (such as an image) without actually removing data

<br />**Lossy Compression** an algorithm which relies on removing or modifying data to achieve a lower storage space

### Examples:

**Lossless vs Lossy**

In this example the lossless compression does reduce the overall size of the image, but only slightly. However, the quality is almost the same as the original. The lossy compression is a more extreme one, but it clearly managed to reduce the size of the image at the expense of its quality
