# Computer Network, Parallel/Distributed computing

## Computer Networks 

### Definitions

**Computer Networks** - Computer networks can best be described as a set of computers that are on an interconected network that can share and recieve content form each other.

<br /> Networks can be broken into nodes and links. Nodes can be modem, hubs(data communicagtion equipment) or data terminal equipment like two or more computers or printers. These are connected via links which are either physical(optical fibers) or freespace(wireless)

<br /> Networks can allow services to operate virtually, have changes in the serivce occur quickly, and having stronger protections(via encryption in network)

**Fault Tolerant Networks** - Fault tolerant networks are considered to be redundent, which means that they are linked in such a way that should one of the lines int he network or one of the devices in the network fail, information could still be delivered throughout the rest of the network.

## Parallel/Distributed Computing

### Definitions

**Distributed Computing** - dividing portions of a computationally intensive task to be computed by multiple computers simultaneously working on different sections. 

Distributed Computing can only complete tasks at the speed of the slowest processor. For example in a situation where acomputer can finish a task in 20 seconds and another computer can finish another task in 50 seconds, the overall time for the program to run would be 50 seconds. 


**Parallel Computing** - Multiple Processors within a single computer conduct a multitiude of tasks to execute a program at the same time. This occurs in only one computer. 

This form of parallel computing can also be known as Task parallelism
