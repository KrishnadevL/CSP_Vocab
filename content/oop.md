# OOP, Class, Attribute, Method, Object
## Object-Oriented Programming (+Object, Attribute and Method)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) stands for object oriented programming and is a type of programming language based on objects which are collections of data held in "attributes" that are derived from a "class" template. The attribute is the variable assigned to the object and the method is a function-like reusable portions of code designed specifically to be called on objects in OOP.
## Class
A basic template for creating an object in OOP, defines the attributes and types.
