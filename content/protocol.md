# Protocol, TCP/IP, HTTP, GET, POST

## Protocol
A specified, standardized procedure for operating with data on a computer network, usually pertaining to its transmission over the internet.  TCP, IP, HTTP(S), SSH, and SMTP are all popular examples of internet protocols.

## TCP/IP Model
A model of the internet which divides the transmission of data into 4 basic layers (application, transport, internet, and network access).  Virtually all internet communication is through TCP/IP.  IP addresses are a well known part of the IP model, each computer has an identifiable number that marks its communication.

## HTTP(S)
HyperText Transfer Protocol (also HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure).  An internet protocol used for web communication.  Like it's name implies it transfers web files as text over the internet.  It is extremely popular and has its secured alternative, HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure, and has sub-protocols like GET and POST.

## GET
GET is an HTTP method (something sent at the beggining of an HTTP request) that is sent from a client to a server to get the data.  It is done in the form of URLs and is in the header of an HTTP request.

## POST
POST is another HTTP method where the client sends data to the server.  It can be used to update data on the server according to the client.  It is in the body of the HTTP request rather than the head.
